## YKE (Yoofi's Kubernetes Engine)

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to allow anybody to provision a self-managed Kubernetes cluster with great opinions baked in the software that is running on the cluster.

Many times if you want a Kubernetes cluster that is managed by a cloud provider (EKS, GKE, AKS), you would have to install a bunch of software on top of it for actual practical use, such as:

- Ingress controllers
- Certificate management controllers
